README for queuegraph

To install, adjust the path to your rrdtools binaries in queuegraph-rrd.sh

Create a cronjob that runs queuegraph-rrd.sh every minute -- this
populates the *.rrd database:

* * * * * /webroot/queuegraph-rrd.sh

Now put queuegraph.cgi into the cgi-bin directory of your webserver.
