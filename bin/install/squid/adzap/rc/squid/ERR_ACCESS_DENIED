This ad-zapper attempts to constrain service to ZipWorld customers only.
If you are a ZipWorld customer and still receive this error message,
please contact me on &lt;<A HREF="mailto:%w">%w</A>&gt;
to report this problem. I would also appreciate knowing:
<UL>
    <LI>The date and time you received this message.
    <LI>The IP address of your computer.<BR>
	UNIX users can obtain this from the output of the command:<BR>
	<TT>ifconfig -a</TT><BR>
	Windows users can obtain this by running the command:<BR>
	<TT>winipcfg</TT> (Win9x) or <TT>ipconfig</TT> (WinNT and Win2k)
</UL>
This will let me check your IP address against the (huge!) list
of IP ranges ZipWorld deal with.
<EM>Please</EM> contact me with this information
rather than simply abandoning the zapper.
<P>
Thank you,<BR>
