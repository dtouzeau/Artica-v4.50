Instructions for applying the update:

Attached is a new script. This is all you really need; it is the perl script
autogenerated from the pattern list. Simply copy it over the existing script
and restart your squid server.  The command "squid -k reconfigure" will do this.

NB: if you copy it over the old script the update should already be
executable, but if you install it some other way be sure to remember to add
execute permission to the script.
