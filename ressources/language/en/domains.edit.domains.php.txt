<roundrobin>Round Robin</roundrobin>
<roundrobin_text>Round robin DNS is a technique of load distribution, load balancing, or fault-tolerance provisioning multiple,
 redundant Mail Protocol service hosts, e.g., by managing the Domain Name System's (DNS) 
 responses to address requests from Mail server according to an appropriate statistical model.[br]
In its simplest implementation Round-robin DNS works by responding to DNS requests not only with a single IP address,[br]
 but a list of IP addresses of several servers that host identical services.[br]
The order in which IP addresses from the list are returned is the basis for the term round robin.[br]
 With each DNS response, the IP address sequence in the list is permuted. Usually, basic IP clients attempt connections with the first 
address returned from a DNS query so that on different connection attempts clients would receive service from different providers, thus distributing the overall load among servers.</roundrobin_text>
