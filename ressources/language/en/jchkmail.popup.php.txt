<badmx_explain>This check consists in checking MXs (name and address) of the domain part of the sender address against a blacklist.[br]
Some spammers use domain names with MXs defined on private networks or at IP addresses without any real machine configured at that address.[br]
Usually you can reject messages if the domain part of the sender address can't receive mail (you can't answer him).[br]
This kind of check doesn't block too much spam, but can alleviate mail queue from bounces to unreacheable addresses...</badmx_explain>

<greylist_explain>[b]Default Greylisting Behaviour[/b] - You have to decide if you will enable greylisting
for all of your users and disable for those who don't want this feature or if you will enable only for some of your users.[br]
Generally, you can start with the last option, with some "beta testers" and if people are happy with greylisting,
migrate to the first option and remove those who don't want greylisting (this is how we've done at our domain).</greylist_explain>
<greylist_intro>j-chkmail implements greylisting method from Evan Harris.
j-chkmail implementation is intended to be used on huge servers.[br]
So, it tries to reduce the number of entries on database,
and uses results from other filtering methods to remove unwanted entries.[br]
Other than original databases (pending and validated entries),
j-chkmail uses two new databases : whitelisted entries and blacklisted entries.
Whitelisted entries database contains only couples of IP and domain names.</greylist_intro>

<NetClass_explain>What's this ???[br]
"Network Classes" is a way to handle in a differently connections coming from different sources.[br]
Surely, you don't want to grant the same rights to clients in your local network and unknown clients in the other side of the world.[br]
Assigning "Network Classes" to networks is a comprehensive way to aggregate heterogeneous networks (IPv4, IPv6, host names, â€¦)
in order to assign common privileges, without having to specify all IP addresses/networks for each control parameter.</NetClass_explain>

<RejectShortMsgs_explain>If your mail server frequently has to handle unwanted messages
whose body size is very short (say, something like a dozen characters), it's possible to reject them.[br]
This kind of messages are usually sent by people wanting to validate a list of email addresses.[br]
So, they slowly send one message per address and wait for a bounce.[br]
If the message doesn't bounce, that means that the email address is probably a valid address.[br]
Sometimes, a short code is added to the message to ease correlation between a bounced message and an email address</RejectShortMsgs_explain>
