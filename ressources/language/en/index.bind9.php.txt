<AddNewDnsReverseZone>To create the reverse Zone, give the first IP address of your DNS Domain
For example: 192.168.1.1 or 10.10.10.1 or 192.168.0.1...</AddNewDnsReverseZone>
<AddNewDnsZone_explain>Give here the domain that will be added after your computer names

<forward_text>A "forward zone" is a way to configure forwarding on a per-domain basis.[br]
A zone statement of type forward can contain a forward and/or forwarders statement,
which will apply to queries within the domain given by the zone name.[br]
If no forwarders statement is present or an empty list for forwarders is given, then no forwarding will be done for the domain,
canceling the effects of any forwarders in the options statement.[br]
Thus if you want to use this type of zone to change the behavior of the global forward option
(that is, "forward first to", then "forward only", or vice versa, but want to use the same servers as set globally) you need to respecify the global forwarders.</forward_text>

<hint>Hint zone</hint>
<hint_text>The initial set of root nameservers is specified using a "hint zone".[br]
When the server starts up, it uses the root hints to find a root nameserver and get the most recent list of root nameservers.[br]
If no hint zone is specified for class IN, the server uses a compiled-in default set of root servers hints.[br]
Classes other than IN have no built-in defaults hints.</hint_text>

<slave>Slave</slave>
<slave_text>A slave zone is a replica of a master zone.[br]
The masters list specifies one or more IP addresses of master servers that the slave contacts to update its copy of the zone.[br]
By default, transfers are made from port 53 on the servers;[br]
this can be changed for all servers by specifying a port number before the list of IP addresses, or on a per-server basis after the IP address.[br]
Authentication to the master can also be done with per-server TSIG keys.[br]
If a file is specified, then the replica will be written to this file whenever the zone is changed, and reloaded from this file on a server restart.[br]</slave_text>
<stub>stub</stub>
<stub_text>A stub zone is similar to a slave zone, except that it replicates only the NS records of a master zone instead of the entire zone.[br]
Stub zones are not a standard part of the DNS;[br]
they are a feature specific to the BIND implementation.[br]
Stub zones can be used to eliminate the need for glue NS record in a parent zone at the expense of maintaining a
stub zone entry and a set of name server addresses in global settings.[br]
This usage is not recommended for new configurations, and BIND 9 supports it only in a limited way.</stub_text>
