Sets the size of the underlying logging area of the Berkeley DB environment.[br]
By default, or if the value is set to 0, the minimum region size is used, approximately 128KB.[br]
The log region is used to store filenames, and so may need to be increased in size if a large number of files will be opened and registered with the specified Berkeley DB environment's log manager

<set_lg_regionmax>size of the underlying logging area</set_lg_regionmax>
<set_lg_max>Maximum size of a single file in the log</set_lg_max>
<set_lg_max_text>
Sets the maximum size of a single file in the log.[br]
The value set for this parameter may not be larger than the maximum unsigned four-byte value.[br]
When the logging subsystem is configured for on-disk logging, the default size of a log file is 10MB.[br]
When the logging subsystem is configured for in-memory logging, the default size of a log file is 256KB.[br]
In addition, the configured log buffer size must be larger than the log file size.[br]
(The logging subsystem divides memory configured for in-memory log records into "files", 
as database environments configured for in-memory log records may exchange log records with 
other members of a replication group, and those members may be configured to store log records on-disk.)[br]
When choosing log buffer and file sizes for in-memory logs, applications should ensure the in-memory log buffer size is large enough that no transaction 
will ever span the entire buffer, and avoid a state where the in-memory buffer
 is full and no space can be freed because a transaction that started in the first log "file" 
 is still active. 
</set_lg_max_text>
<set_lg_bsize>size of the in-memory log buffer</set_lg_bsize>
<set_lg_bsize_text>Sets the size of the in-memory log buffer.[br]
For the DB, when the logging subsystem is configured for on-disk logging, the default size of 
the in-memory log buffer is approximately 32KB.[br]
For the BDB SQL interface, when the logging subsystem is configured for on-disk logging,
 the default size of the in-memory log buffer is approximately 64KB.[br]
 Log information is stored in-memory until the storage space fills up or a transaction commit forces the 
 information to be flushed to stable storage.[br]
 In the presence of long-running transactions or transactions producing large amounts of data,
larger buffer sizes can increase throughput.[br]
When the logging subsystem is configured for in-memory logging, the default size of the in-memory log 
buffer is 1MB.[br]
Log information is stored in-memory until the storage space fills up or transaction abort or commit frees up
 the memory for new transactions.[br]
 In the presence of long-running transactions or transactions producing large amounts of data, 
 the buffer size must be sufficient to hold all log information that can accumulate during the longest 
 running transaction.[br]
 When choosing log buffer and file sizes for in-memory logs, applications should ensure the in-memory 
 and avoid a state where the in-memory buffer is full and no space can be freed because a 
 transaction that started in the first log "file" is still active.</set_lg_bsize_text>
 <set_cachesize>size of the shared memory buffer pool</set_cachesize>
 <set_cachesize_text>
 Sets the size of the shared memory buffer pool — that is, the cache.[br]
 The cache should be the size of the normal working data set of the application, 
 with some small amount of additional memory for unusual situations.[br]
 (Note: the working set is not the same as the number of pages accessed simultaneously, and is usually 
 much larger.)[br]
The value specified for this parameter is the maximum value that your application will be able to use for your in-memory cache. If your application does not have enough data to fill up the amount of space specified here, then your application will only use the amount of memory required by the data that your application does have.
For the DB, the default cache size is 8MB.[br]
You cannot specify a cache size value of less than 100KB.[br]
Any cache size less than 500MB is automatically increased by 25% to account for cache overhead;
 cache sizes larger than 500MB are used as specified.[br]
 The maximum size of a single cache is 4GB on 32-bit systems and 10TB on 64-bit systems.[br]
 (All sizes are in powers-of-two, that is, 256KB is 2^18 not 256,000.)[br]
It is possible to specify cache sizes large enough they cannot be allocated contiguously on some architectures.[br]
 For example, some releases of Solaris limit the amount of memory that may be allocated contiguously by a 
 process.[br]
If ncache is 0 or 1, the cache will be allocated contiguously in memory.[br]
If it is greater than 1, the cache will be split across ncache separate regions, where the region size 
is equal to the initial cache size divided by ncache.[br]
The cache size supplied to this parameter will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the region size and 
may not be larger than the maximum possible cache size configured for your application 
(use the set_cache_max to do this).[br]
The ncache parameter is ignored when resizing the cache.
The syntax of this parameter is a single line with the string one or more whitespace characters, 
and the initial cache size specified in three parts: the gigabytes of cache, the additional bytes of cache,and the number of caches, also separated by whitespace characters.

<iscsi_explain>iSCSI is an abbreviation of Internet Small Computer System Interface, 
an Internet Protocol (IP)-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities.[br]
By carrying SCSI commands over IP networks, iSCSI is used to facilitate data transfers over intranets and to manage storage

 iSCSI can be used to transmit data over local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs),

In Block I/O it defines a mapping between  a  "Logical  Unit Number" and a given block device.[br]
This mode will perform direct block i/o with the device,  bypassing  page-cache for  all operations.[br]
This allows for efficient handling of non-aligned sector transfers (virtualized  environments)  and  large block  transfers  (media servers).[br]
This mode works ideally with high-end storage HBAs and for applications that  either  do  not need  caching  between  application  and  disk or need the large block throughput.

They require a few patches to the kernel and make use of new kernel features for process scheduling, isolation and network isolation between containers.[br]

<samba_strict_allocate>Windows behaviour storage blocks</samba_strict_allocate>
<samba_strict_allocate_text>controls the handling of disk space allocation in the server.[br]
When this is set the server will change from UNIX behaviour of not committing real disk storage blocks when a file 
is extended to the Windows behaviour of actually forcing the disk system to allocate real storage blocks when a file
 is created or extended to be a given size.[br]
In UNIX terminology this means that Samba will stop creating sparse files.[br]
This can be slow on some systems.[br]
When you work with large files like >100MB or so you may even run into problems with clients running into timeouts.[br]
When you have an extent based filesystem it's likely that we can make use of unwritten extents which allows Samba
 to allocate even large amounts of space very fast and you will not see any timeout problems caused by strict allocate.[br]
 With strict allocate in use you will also get much better out of quota messages in case you use quotas.[br]
 Another advantage of activating this setting is that it will help to reduce file fragmentation.[br]
To give you an idea on which filesystems this setting might currently be a good option for you: XFS, ext4, btrfs, ocfs2 on Linux and JFS2 on AIX support unwritten extents.[br]
On Filesystems that do not support it, preallocation is probably an expensive operation where you will 
see reduced performance and risk to let clients run into timeouts when creating large files.[br]
Examples are ext3, ZFS, HFS+ and most others, so be aware if you activate this setting on those filesystems

 Since the timer is reset for every subsequent request, it is not necessary to have a long blocking period;
 in the event of a DoS attack, this timer will keep getting reset.[br]

<DDOS_WHITE_EXPLAIN>
IP addresses of trusted clients can be whitelisted to insure they are never
denied.[br]The purpose of whitelisting is to protect software, scripts, local
searchbots, or other automated tools from being denied for requesting large
amounts of data from the server.[br]Whitelisting should *not* be used to add
customer lists or anything of the sort, as this will open the server to abuse.[br]
This module is very difficult to trigger without performing some type of
malicious attack, and for that reason it is more appropriate to allow the
module to decide on its own whether or not an individual customer should be
blocked.</DDOS_WHITE_EXPLAIN>

<freeweb_reverse_proxy_explain>
Apache can be configured in both a forward and reverse proxy mode.[br]
An ordinary forward proxy is an intermediate server that sits between the client and the origin server.[br]
In order to get content from the origin server, the client sends a request to the proxy naming the origin server as the target 
and the proxy then requests the content from the origin server and returns it to the client.[br]
The client must be specially configured to use the forward proxy to access other sites.[br]
A typical usage of a forward proxy is to provide Internet access to internal clients that are otherwise restricted by a firewall

<samba_virtual_explain>Virtual servers are a technique for creating the illusion of multiple NetBIOS servers on the network,
when in reality there is only one.[br]
The technique is simple to implement: a machine simply registers more than one NetBIOS name in association with its IP address.[br]
There are tangible benefits to doing this.[br]
The accounting department, for example, might have an accounting server, and clients of it would see just the accounting disks and printers. The marketing department could have their own server, marketing, with their own reports, and so on. However,
 all the services would be provided by one medium-sized Unix workstation (and one relaxed administrator),
  instead of having one small server and one administrator per department.

<samba_wins_explain>broadcasting - whether it be browsing or name registration and resolution - does not pass easily across 
multiple subnets.[br]
In addition, many broadcasts tend to bog down networks.[br]
To solve this problem, Microsoft now provides the Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS),
 a cross-subnet NBNS, which Samba supports.[br]
 With it, an administrator can designate a single machine to act as a WINS server,
 and can then provide each client that requires name resolution the address of the WINS server.[br]
 Consequently, name registration and resolution requests can be directed to a single machine from any point on the network, 
 instead of broadcast.

You can add ip addresses like 192.168.12.23 or 192.168.1.255 where 192.168.12.23 is either the LMB IP address or the broadcast 
address of the remote network That is, the LMB is at 192.168.12.23, or the address could be given as 192.168.1.255 where the netmask is assumed to be 24 bits
(255.255.255.0).[br]When the remote announcement is made to the broadcast address of the remote network, every host will receive our announcements. This is noisy and therefore undesirable but may be necessary if we do not know the IP address of the remote LMB.
DOMAIN is optional (the workgroup) and can be either our own workgroup or that of the remote network.[br]
If you use the workgroup name of the remote network, our NetBIOS machine names will end up looking like they belong to that workgroup.[br]

<zarafa_mysql_tuning_text>It is imperative that you correctly configure MySQL to achieve maximum performance on your server;[br]
Almost all performance bottlenecks are within the database access itself, so getting your SQL queries to run as quickly as 
possible is very important.[br]
For large installations, it is also a good idea to tune Zarafa's cache parameters as well;[br]
These are normally set quite low to make sure that Zarafa can run on relatively low-end servers,
but in anything but the smallest installations, these defaults needs to be upped.[br]
Any installation with 50 or more users should definitely tune the cache parameters for maximum performance.

However, do not set it too large because competition for the physical memory might cause paging in the operating system,

size that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk.[br]
A large log buffer allows large transactions to run without a need to write the log to disk before the transactions commit.[br]
If you have big transactions, making the log buffer larger will save disk I/O.
This value should be 32Mb.

Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Proxy Server provides anti-virus protection for network traffic routed through proxy servers
which support the Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP).[br]
[b]The program allows:[/b][br]
Perform anti-virus scans on objects transferred through the proxy server.[br]
Cure infected objects, or block access to infected objects if disinfection fails.[br]
Use group settings to define filtration parameters that are applied depending on the address of the user
requesting an object, and the object's address (URL).[br]
Log activity statistics, including information about anti-virus scanning and its results, and application errors and
warnings.[br]
Notify administrators about detection of malicious software.[br]
[i]The anti-virus databases are used in the detection and disinfection of infected objects. The application uses
database records to analyze every object, checking it for virus presence: its content is compared with code
typical for specific viruses.[/i]

<authoritativeDHCP_explain>
The DHCP server will normally assume that the configuration information about a given network segment is not known to be correct 
and is not authoritative.[br]
This is so that if a naive user installs a DHCP server not fully understanding how to configure it,
 it does not send spurious DHCPNAK messages to clients that have obtained addresses from a legitimate DHCP server on the network.[br]
Network administrators setting up authoritative DHCP servers for their networks should always use authoritative to indicate that the DHCP server should 
send DHCPNAK messages to misconfigured clients.[br]
If this is not done, clients will be unable to get a correct IP address after changing subnets until their old lease has expired, 
which could take quite a long time.[br]
However, if a DHCP server is to be set up so that it is aware of some networks for which it is authoritative and 
some networks for which it is not, it may be more appropriate to declare authority on a per-network-segment basis.[br]
Note that the most specific scope for which the concept of authority makes any sense is the physical network segment 
- either a shared-network statement or a subnet statement that is not contained within a shared-network statement[↓r]
It is not meaningful to specify that the server is authoritative for some subnets within a shared network, 
but not authoritative for others, nor is it meaningful to specify that the server is authoritative for some 
host declarations and not others.
</authoritativeDHCP_explain>
<authoritative>authoritative</authoritative>
<DHCPPing_check>Test if address is already exists</DHCPPing_check>
<DHCPPing_check_explain>When the DHCP server is considering dynamically allocating an IP address to a client,
 it first sends an ICMP Echo request (a ping) to the address being assigned.[br]
 It waits for a second, and if no ICMP Echo response has been heard, it assigns the address.[br]
 If a response is heard, the lease is abandoned, and the server does not respond to the client.[br]
This ping check introduces a default one-second delay in responding to DHCPDISCOVER messages,
which can be a problem for some clients.[br]
The default delay of one second may be configured using the ping-timeout parameter.[br].

<squidcacheperf_howto>Your proxy service is intended to store internet objects into the server local disks.[br]
In this case, when users requesting objects, objects should be downloaded directly from the proxy and not from Internet.[br]
This to safe your Internet bandwidth and to speed the retreival object through the local network (10Mb/100Mb/1Gb).[br]
If your cache is under 50% performance ratio, this means your server is misconfigured and you have to change some parameters.[br]
It depends on what kind of objects your users downloading from Internet.[br]
For example streaming videos cannot be cached by your server but their filesize are calculated in statistics.[br]
So if you using a lot of websites that provides streaming, it is normal that you have a lower performance.[br]
You have several ways to increase the caching performance:</squidcacheperf_howto> 
<minimum_object_size_squid_howto>These directives define which objects can be stored on caches.[br]
If you define a higher minimal value, web pages or little images will be not be cached.[br]
In the opposite if you define a lower value for maximal size some big images and files that should never be modified will be not cached.[br]For example, updates repositories servers.
</minimum_object_size_squid_howto>
<caches_storage_resources>Cache storage resources</caches_storage_resources>
<caches_storage_resources_howto>Your server store objects into databases with a pre-defined size.[br]
These databases are important because if the proxy server have not enough spaces, it cannot store objects and try to get them directly from Internet.[br]
So you need to ensure that you have some storages to save objects in your server.

<apache_mod_fcgid_explain>
mod_fcgid is a high performance alternative to mod_cgi or mod_cgid, 
which starts a sufficient number instances of the CGI program to handle concurrent requests,
and these programs remain running to handle further incoming requests.[br]
It is favored by the PHP developers, for example, as a preferred alternative to running mod_php in-process,
delivering very similar performance.

<APP_CGROUPS>Process Groups</APP_CGROUPS>
<howto_cgroups>
This feature allows you to tweak memory, bandwidth and CPU usage of system processes as well as deny access to system resources.[br]
The biggest advantage of Process Groups is to impose limits on different workloads.[br]
So they get their required performance and/or don't impact other workloads running on the same server.[br]
In this section, you can limit how much CPU/memory applications is going to use or build more complex balancing policies.[br]
When you are consolidating many workloads in a single server, it's extremely important to guarantee how much resources they are using.[br]
Something that is inherently done when you have many physical servers because each box is a resource limit on itself.

<memory_memsw_limit_text>sets the maximum amount for the sum of memory and swap usage</memory_memsw_limit_text>
<memory_soft_limit_text>
Soft limits allow for greater sharing of memory.[br]
The idea behind soft limits is to allow control groups to use as much of the memory as needed, provided
[br]
a. There is no memory contention[br]
b. They do not exceed their hard limit[br]
[br]
When the system detects memory contention or low memory, control groups
are pushed back to their soft limits.[br]If the soft limit of each control
group is very high, they are pushed back as much as possible to make
sure that one control group does not starve the others of memory.[br]
Please note that soft limits is a best effort feature, it comes with
no guarantees, but it does its best to make sure that when memory is
heavily contended for, memory is allocated based on the soft limit
hints/setup.
</memory_soft_limit_text>
<swappiness>% of Swap utilization</swappiness>
<swappiness_text>sets the tendency of the kernel to swap out process memory used by tasks in this cgroup instead 
of reclaiming pages from the page cache.[br]
This is the same tendency, calculated the same way.[br]
The default value is 60. Values lower than 60 decrease the kernel's tendency to swap out process memory, 
values greater than 60 increase the kernel's tendency to swap out process memory, 
and values greater than 100 permit the kernel to swap out pages that are part of the address space of the processes in this cgroup. 
</swappiness_text>
<memory_limit>Memory limit</memory_limit>
<cpu_shares>CPU shares</cpu_shares>
<cpu_shares_text>contains an integer value that specifies a relative share of CPU time available to the tasks in a cgroup.[br]
For example, tasks in two cgroups that have shares set to 1 will receive equal CPU time, 
but tasks in a cgroup that has shares set to 2 receive twice the CPU time of tasks in a cgroup where shares is set to 1.
</cpu_shares_text>

<cpu_rt_runtime_us_text>specifies a period of time in microseconds for the longest continuous period in which the tasks

Establishing this limit prevents tasks in one cgroup from monopolizing CPU time.[br]
If the tasks in a cgroup should be able to access CPU resources for 4 seconds out of every 5 seconds,
 set  to 4000000 and runtime period to 5000000.

[h3]Transparent mode limitations (please read it)[/h3]
[ul]
[li]Intercepting HTTP breaks TCP/IP standards because user agents think they are talking directly to the origin server.[/li]
[li]Requires IPv4 with NAT.[/li]
[li]It causes path-MTU (PMTUD) to fail, possibly making some remote sites inaccessible.[br] This is not usually a problem if your client machines are connected via Ethernet or DSL PPPoATM where the MTU of all links between the cache and client is 1500 or more. If your clients are connecting via DSL PPPoE then this is likely to be a problem as PPPoE links often have a reduced MTU (1472 is very common).[/li]
[li]Proxy authentication does not work, and IP based authentication conceptually fails because the users are all seen to come from the Proxy own IP address.[/li]
[li]You can't use IDENT lookups (which are inherently very insecure anyway).[/li]
[li]Transparent mode is incompatible with IP filtering designed to prevent address spoofing.[/li]
[li]Clients are still expected to have full Internet DNS resolving capabilities; in certain intranet/firewalling setups, this is not always wanted.[/li]
[li]Related to above: suppose the users browser connects to a site which is down. However, due to the transparent proxying, it gets a connected state to the interceptor[br]The end user may get wrong error messages or a hung browser, for seemingly unknown reasons to them.[/li]

<SambaUseBackendAD_text>If checked the sharing engine will use tdbsam has backend instead using RID.
tdbsam force Samba storing user and machine account data in a "TDB" (trivial database).[br]
This backend does not require any additional configuration.[br]
This backend is recommended for new installations that do not require LDAP system.
As a general guide, the Samba Team does not recommend using the tdbsam backend for sites that have 250 or more users.[br]
All Windows accounts have a unique security identifier (SID).[br]
The last four digits of this identifier are unique within any given domain and are called the relative identifier (RID).[br]
The RID module maps IDs by adding the RID to the minimum value in the idmap range (100000 - 199999).[br]

<SambaAllowTrustedDomains_text>This is useful if you only want your Samba server to serve resources to users in the domain it is a member of.[br]
As an example, suppose that there are two domains DOMA and DOMB.[br]
DOMB is trusted by DOMA, which contains the Samba server.[br]
Under normal circumstances, a user with an account in DOMB can then access the resources of a UNIX account with the same account name on the 
Samba server even if they do not have an account in DOMA.[br]
This can make implementing a security boundary difficult.</SambaAllowTrustedDomains_text>
<SambaWinbindUseDefaultDomain>Remove domain in user account</SambaWinbindUseDefaultDomain>
<SambaWinbindUseDefaultDomain_text>Operate on users without domain component in their username.[br]
Users without a domain component are treated as is part of the winbindd server's own domain.[br]
While this does not benifit Windows users, it makes SSH, FTP and e-mail function in a way much closer to the way they would in a native unix system.[br]
If not checked, users must authenticate has following : "DOMAIN\user". [br]
In the opposite, if checked users must authenticate has following : "user". [br]

<SambaWinBindCacheTime_explain>
This parameter specifies the number of seconds the winbindd daemon will cache user and group information before 
querying the Active Directory server.[br]
When a item in the cache is older than this time winbindd will ask the domain controller for the sequence number 
of the server's account database.[br]
If the sequence number has not changed then the cached item is marked as valid for a further winbind cache time seconds.[br]
Otherwise the item is fetched from the server.[br]
This means that as long as the account database is not actively changing winbindd will only have to send one 
sequence number query packet every winbind cache time seconds.

For example you can block porn,ads categories from 12:00 to 17:00, Monday to Friday with one rule 
and block socialnet,games,porn,ads categories from 09:00 to 12h00 only Monday and friday.[br]

<DNSBL_WHY>A DNSBL (DNS-based Blackhole List, Block List, or Black-list; see below) is a list of IP addresses published through the Internet Domain Name Service (DNS) either as a zone file that can be used by DNS server software, or as a live DNS zone that can be queried in real-time.[br]
DNSBLs are most often used to publish the addresses of computers or networks linked to spamming; 
most mail server software can be configured to reject or flag messages which have been sent from a site listed on one or 
more such lists.[br]
DNSBL is a software mechanism, rather than a specific list or policy.[br]
There are dozens of DNSBLs in existence,which use a wide array of criteria for listing and delisting of addresses.[br]
These may include listing the addresses of zombie computers or other machines being used to send spam, listing the addresses of ISPs who willingly host spammers, or listing addresses which have sent spam to a honeypot system.

<apache_explain_LargeFileLimit>Type is the filename extension, or * for all. E.g. you can use ".tgz" to match only tar-compressed files, ".avi" to match video files.[br]
minimum size is the minimum size (in kbytes) of the file to be matched.[br]
That way you can match huge video files that hog your bandwidth.
</apache_explain_LargeFileLimit>
<apache_explain_MaxConnection>max connections is the maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed from the source.[br]
Any connection over the max will get a 503 Service Temporarily Unavailable.
 source may be a full host (host.domain.tld), part of a domain , an ip address (192.168.218.5) , a network mask (192.168.1.0/24), or "all".
If max connections is 0, there is no limit.[br]
Note:[br]
You NEED to have a bandwidth rule limit for the same origin.[br]
It doesnt need to be a low limit, you can use an unlimited setting.[br]
The reason has to do with the way the program manages memory.[br]
If you dont put a bandwidth rule using the same origin, Max connections will be ignored.</apache_explain_MaxConnection>

<squid_redirectors_howto>Redirectors are used when you need to filter Internet Access with engines that parse URLs requested by browsers.[br]
There are used when enabling The Web-Filtering service,squidguard,adzapper or caching dynamic content features.[br]
Sometimes you need to tweaks these parameters.[br]It Depends on the requests number and users number against your server performances.

<url_rewrite_children>MAX redirector processes</url_rewrite_children>
<url_rewrite_children_text>The maximum number of redirector processes to spawn.[br]If you limit it too few 
Squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of URLs, slowing it down.[br]
If you allow too many they will use more RAM and other system resources noticeably</url_rewrite_children_text>
<url_rewrite_startup>Pre-spawn processes</url_rewrite_startup>
<url_rewrite_startup_text>Sets a minimum of how many processes are to be spawned when Squid starts or reconfigures.[br]
When set to zero the first request will cause spawning of the first child process to handle it.[br]
Starting too few will cause an initial slowdown in traffic as Squid attempts to simultaneously spawn enough processes to cope.
</url_rewrite_startup_text>
<url_rewrite_idle>available processes</url_rewrite_idle>
<url_rewrite_idle_text>
Sets a minimum of how many processes Squid is to try and keep available at all times.[br]
When traffic begins to rise above what the existing processes can handle this many more will be spawned up to the maximum configured.[br]
A minimum setting of 1 is required.
</url_rewrite_idle_text>
<url_rewrite_concurrency>concurrency Processes</url_rewrite_concurrency>
<url_rewrite_concurrency_text>The number of requests each redirector helper can handle in parallel.[br]
Defaults to 0 which indicates the redirector is a old-style single threaded redirector.[br]
When this directive is set to a value >= 1 then the protocol used to communicate with the helper is modified to include a request ID in front of the request/response.[br]
The request ID from the request must be echoed back with the response to that request.
