<APP_PRELOAD_NOTINSTALLED>Preload daemon is not installed</APP_PRELOAD_NOTINSTALLED>
<APP_PRELOAD_NOTINSTALLED_TEXT>Preload is an "adaptive readahead daemon" that runs in the background of your system,
and observes what programs you use most often, caching them in order to speed up application load time.[br]
By using Preload, you can put unused RAM to good work, and improve the overall performance of your system.[br]
Installing Preload on Ubuntu is easily done with the command:[b]apt-get install preload[/b][br]
Once installed, Preload will start, and no further action is necessary, but read on for configuration options,
to learn how to monitor Preload's activities, and see what kind of improvements Preload will bring to your system.</APP_PRELOAD_NOTINSTALLED_TEXT>

<ARTICA_PROCESS_SCHEDULE_EXPLAIN>In order to provide statistics,grapÄ¥s and services informations,Artica need to run some processes in background mode.[br]
These processes will should consume system resources.[br]You can define here these processes execution frequency.[br]A shorter period will consume more resources but will display you a real status.[br]
A longer period will safe your system resources but will extend visibility of of your services and statistics status.</ARTICA_PROCESS_SCHEDULE_EXPLAIN>

[br]It locks SpamAssassin, amavis and syslog-ng+Myslq services startup in order to safe computer memory.[br]

<log_fifo_size>Output Buffers</log_fifo_size>
<log_fifo_size_text>Here is an extremely important setting.[br]
The "Output Buffers" also "log_fifo_size" setting sizes the output buffer, which every destination has.[br]
The output buffer must be large enough to store the incoming messages of every source.[br]
This setting can be set globally or per destination.[br]
For the "Output Buffers", the number indicated is the number of
lines/entries/messages that it can hold.[br]
By default, it is globally set, extremely conservatively -
and if you do any amount of traffic, you will end up seeing dropped messages at some point.[br]
The statistics that include dropped messages are printed to syslog every 10 minutes unless you have altered this.[br]
In the statistics line it will let you know which destination is dropping messages and how many.[br]
You can then make determinations there of whether to globally increase it or per destination,
and also an idea of how much larger you need to make it.</log_fifo_size_text>

<MaxtimeBackupMailSizeCalculate>Calculate storages size each</MaxtimeBackupMailSizeCalculate>
<MaxtimeBackupMailSizeCalculate_explain>When you use quarantine area and backup On the Fly feature, artica will calculate periodically these areas disk consumption.[br]
This processing should consume I/O on your disk and should decrease server performance during the calculation.[br]
You should increase or decrease the interval according to the average size of these areas.[br]
The default value has been calculated for a quarantine/backup area of 10G disk size</MaxtimeBackupMailSizeCalculate_explain>

<NoBootWithoutIP_explain>When the server boot-up some services should take time because the server did not already have a network IP address. [br]
Especially if the server is running in DHCP Client mode.[br]
If you enable this feature, Artica will start services only if the server has an IP address.[br]This feature is designed to speed the boot time.</NoBootWithoutIP_explain>

<syslogng_intro>If you are still having trouble with dropped messages,
look into using flow control within syslog-ng.[br]
Flow control allows you to finely tune the amount of messages received from a source.[br][br]
Although, there are potential other issues you must account for, such as slowing down the source application if
it cannot hand off its log messages, etc.[br][br]
Users with traditional syslog clients sending their logs via UDP, should have a look at this page on UDP Buffer Sizing.[br][br]
Also, "Flushing Buffers" and "Output Buffers" should be tweaked on your client servers as necessary if they are using syslog-ng,
and handle heavy loads, sporadic sources, etc.[br]
Remember to use your statistics log entries to help you identify problems and load effectively.</syslogng_intro>
<syslogng_max_connections>max-connections</syslogng_max_connections>
<syslogng_max_connections_text>if you see a lot of "Number of allowed concurrent connections exceeded" that means you must increase this value.[br]

<syslogng_sync>Flushing Buffers</syslogng_sync>
<syslogng_sync_text>The syslog-ng application buffers the log messages to be sent in an output queue.[br]
The sync() parameter specifies the number of messages held in this buffer.[br][br]
By default, Flushing Buffers is set to 0, which flushes messages immediately - which depending on your logging volume,
can be fairly taxing.[br]
Increasing this number gently, say to 10 or 20, will hold that number of messages in its buffer before they are written to their destination.</syslogng_sync_text>
<syslog_server_consumption>Syslog-ng injection</syslog_server_consumption>
<syslog_server_consumption_text>You using syslog-ng and Artica automatically set it to force sending events to mysql in order to display them.[br]
