By default, everybody can access to your Wordpress sites, but your wordpress sites cannot access to Internet.[br]
If one of your Wordpress site is infected, the malware injected in your Wordpress site will be not able to spam Internet or to send requests to the world.[br]

The time a user and their credentials stay in the logged in user cache since their last request.[br]
When the garbage interval passes, all user credentials that have passed their TTL are removed from memory.
</authenticate_ttl_explain>
<authenticate_ip_ttl_explain>
If you use proxy authentication and the Max IP Per user ACL,this directive controls how long proxy remembers the IP addresses associated with each user.[br]Use a small value (e.g., 60 seconds) if your users might change addresses quickly, as is the case with dialup.[br]
You might be safe using a larger value (e.g., 2 hours) in a corporate LAN environment with relatively static address assignments.
</authenticate_ip_ttl_explain>
<credentialsttl_explain>
Specifies how long the proxy assumes an externally validated username:password pair is valid for.[br]
In other words how often the helper program is called for that user.[br]
Set this low to force revalidation with short lived passwords.

<ModSecurityExplain>This feature inspects HTTP traffic as it arrives at the server.[br]
 When an HTTP request arrives at the server, it's first routed through a dedicated module before it's routed on to the destination application.[br]ModSecurity compares the inbound HTTP request against a list of rules.[br]
  These rules define the form of a malicious or harmful request, so if the incoming request matches a rule, ModSecurity blocks the request from reaching the destination application where it may cause harm.

The server did not send nor acknowledge any data for as long as the "timeout server" setting defined during the data phase.[br]

<maxconn>Maximum number of connections</maxconn>
<haproxy_maxconn>By default, this parameter is set to 2000.[br]This means that a default instance of the load-balancer will start queuing HTTP sessions once it hits 2000 concurrent sessions.
</haproxy_maxconn>
<nbproc>Number of workers</nbproc>
<haproxy_nbproc>By default, the load-balancer service has a single worker process, which means that all of our HTTP sessions will be load balanced by a single process.[br]
 With the Number of workers parameter, it is possible to create multiple worker processes to help distribute the workload internally.[br]While additional worker processes might sound good at first, they only tend to provide value when the server itself has more than 1 CPU.[br]
 It is not uncommon for environments that create multiple worker processes on single CPU systems to see that the load-balancer performs worse than it did as a single process instance.[br]
 The reason for this is because the overhead of managing multiple worker processes provides a diminishing return when the number of workers exceeds the number of CPUs available.

<DNS_CAA_EXPLAIN>A Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) record is used to specify which certificate authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue certificates for a domain.[br]
CAA records allow domain owners to declare which certificate authorities are allowed to issue a certificate for a domain.[br]
They also provide a means of indicating notification rules in case someone requests a certificate from an unauthorized certificate authority.[br]
If no CAA record is present, any CA is allowed to issue a certificate for the domain.[br]
If a CAA record is present, only the CAs listed in the record(s) are allowed to issue certificates for that hostname.[br]
CAA records can set policy for the entire domain or for specific hostnames.[br]

A Domain Name System-based blackhole list, Domain Name System blacklist (DNSBL) or real-time blackhole list (RBL) is a service for operation of mail servers to perform a check via a Domain Name System (DNS) query whether a sending host's IP address is blacklisted for email spam.[1] Most mail server software can be configured to check such lists, typically rejecting or flagging messages from such sites.
<dnsbl_explain>
A DNSBL is a software mechanism, rather than a specific list or policy.[br]
They use a wide array of criteria for listing and delisting addresses.[br]
These may include listing the addresses of zombie computers or other machines being used to send spam, Internet service providers (ISPs) who willingly host spammers, or those which have sent spam to a honeypot system.[br]
This section lists the open public reputation services that your server can query.[br]
Unlike The Shields which uses a dedicated reputation aggregation technology, these lists may have unwanted effects.

<APP_CATEGORIES_CACHE_TEXT>The category caching service improves the performance of Internet query processing.[br]
When Artica searches for a category for a website, it queries Internet databases servers.[br]
This should increase the latency of processing depending on your bandwidth and submissions.[br]
The purpose of this service is to cache websites information in memory to speed up the processing time.</APP_CATEGORIES_CACHE_TEXT>

When Artica import the category databases, the process limit the  databases injection according to their size.[br]
Indeed, some category databases are larger than 1GB (e.g. the Malware category).[br]
Importing and using these big databases can impact the server resources.[br]
This value will limit the import of sites into the cache service. In any case, if a site is not categorized, it will take the traditional path and the Cloud service will be favored.[br]
Modify this value according to your server performance, more your server have memory, more you can use huge databases in memory.

<haproxy_timeout_connect>This timeout works like a grace period.[br]
It sets the maximum time the client has to connect to a server.[br]
The time it takes a client to connect to a server varies widely, depending on network complexity.[br]
The more complex a topology, the longer it can take the client to connect.[br]
The timeout connect allows the client to try to connect again if the initial attempt fails.[br]
 In addition to the connection time, you’ll need to set the numbers of retries.[br]
 The default is three, but you can adjust it to fit your environment.</haproxy_timeout_connect>
 <haproxy_timeout_server>
 When a client sends a request to the server, it expects a response.
[br]If the server doesn’t respond in the configured time duration, this paremeter is invoked.[br]
 This is akin to the timeout client, only in reverse.[br]
You can see in the list of HTTP responses, if a timeout server is invoked, you’ll get a 504 Gateway Timeout response from The Load-balancer.
</haproxy_timeout_server>
<haproxy_timeout_client>
This setting defines the maximum time a client can be inactive when connected to the server.[br]
 A common value for this timeout is five minutes.[br]
You can go with shorter timeouts, even as little as thirty seconds, if you’re attempting to maximize security or the total number of active connections.[br]
As the name suggests, this timeout is handled on the client side.

<kernel_shmmax>Max shared memory</kernel_shmmax>
<kernel_shmmax_explain>This value defines the maximum size of a shared memory segment.[br]
This means that each shared memory segment cannot exceed this size.[br]
The size of each shared memory segment is important because it directly influences the performance of your system.[br]The par value is usually 4294967295 (4 GB) for 64-bit systems.[br]
It is important to note that this value should be less than or equal to half of the total physical memory size of your server.[br]It is recommended to set this value according to the size of the memory available on your server, if you have a large memory you can increase the value, otherwise it is better to leave it as it is to avoid performance problems.</kernel_shmmax_explain>
<kernel_shmall>Shared Memory</kernel_shmall>
<kernel_shmall_explain>
This value determines the total size of shared memory available for systems using System V shared memory.[br]
It is expressed in number of memory pages.[br]
You can increase it. [br]
However, it is important to note that this change will not increase the amount of physical memory available on your system.[br]
It will simply increase the amount of shared memory available for systems using System V shared memory.[br]
For example, if you have 8 GB of physical memory, you can calculate the value as follows:[br]
(8 * 1024 * 1024) / 4096.[br]
This gives 2,097,152, which is the value in number of pages.

<inbound_anomaly_score_threshold>Anomaly Score Threshold</inbound_anomaly_score_threshold>
<inbound_anomaly_score_threshold_explain>An anomaly score threshold is the cumulative anomaly score at which an inbound request or an outbound response will be blocked.[br]
Most detected inbound threats carry an anomaly score of 5 (by default), while smaller violations, e.g. protocol and standards violations, carry lower scores.[br]
An anomaly score threshold of 7, for example, would require multiple rule matches in order to trigger a block (e.g. one critical rule scoring 5 plus a lesser-scoring rule, in order to reach the threshold of 7).[br]An anomaly score threshold of 10 would require at least two critical rules to match, or a combination of many lesser-scoring rules.[br]
 Increasing the anomaly score thresholds makes the WAF less sensitive and hence less likely to block transactions.</inbound_anomaly_score_threshold_explain>

<proxy_transparent_wizard>Enabling transparent mode allows Artica to become a network gateway mode proxy.[br]
This mode eliminates the need to configure the proxy settings in the browser.[br]
A transparent proxy works by intercepting traffic directly at the network layer. In this configuration mode, Artica becomes an intermediate gateway for your network's Internet access.[br]
Consequently, it allows deploying the proxy even on devices not managed by the company.[br]
Once this option is enabled on Artica, you will have two options to deploy this mode of operation.[br]
The first option involves modifying the exit gateway in the DHCP server configuration.[br]
The second option involves performing TCP/IP routing of HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the network address of your transparent Artica server.[br]
 [br]In both scenarios, it is always recommended to secure the firewall at the exit of HTTP/HTTPS traffic to ensure that users cannot access the Internet without going through Artica.

<hotspot_wizardv2>This wizard will build a ready-to-use HotSpot service for you.[br]
This includes a DHCP server to provide addresses to guests and a DNS server to allow browsers to resolve domain names.[br]
Traditionally, a HotSpot server has two network cards.[br]
The first serves the guest network, and the second allows the server to forward requests to the Internet.[br]
Specify here the purpose of each network card.[br]
The HotSpot can also operate with a single network card (do not enter anything in the Internet Card field).[br]But note that network packets must pass through this machine.
[br]You will then need to inform the guest devices that the default Internet gateway will be this Artica server.

<RemoteCategoryQueries>Remote category queries</RemoteCategoryQueries>
<RemoteCategoryQueries_explain>This feature lets you query, via DNS, the category associated with a domain using your own Category Server.[br]Only category names are replicated, so you can reference them in proxy ACLs or DNS-firewall rules.</RemoteCategoryQueries_explain>
<CategoryDatabaseDistribution>Category database distribution</CategoryDatabaseDistribution>
<CategoryDatabaseDistribution_explain>This feature exposes an HTTP port to allow synchronizing two types of databases:[br]
- Web-filtering databases for Artica Proxy[br]
- DNS blocking databases (RPZ — Response Policy Zone) for Artica DNS

<Kerberos_replay_cache_explain>
Enabling the Kerberos replay cache (rcache) protects your service from token re-use (replay) attacks during authentication.[br]
In practice, it’s almost always worth having it on.
The server stores a fingerprint of each authenticator it accepts and rejects any duplicate until it expires (typically the clock-skew window, ~5 minutes).[br]
It’s per-host: it protects that machine from replays of recently seen tokens.[br]
[b]It Blocks stolen-token replays.[/b][br]
The AP-REQ authenticator (timestamp + key material) can be captured and reused by an attacker within the clock-skew window.[br] The cache records seen authenticators and rejects duplicates, stopping one-shot replays (common with HTTP Negotiate on proxies/reverse-proxies).[br]
[b]Prevents duplicate side-effects.[/b][br] Without cache, a replayed token could trigger the same authenticated action again (e.g., POST or admin call) even if no session is established yet.[br]
[b]Buys time before a full GSS context exists.[/b][br]
Many apps only perform the initial Kerberos exchange (no message signing yet).[br]Cache protects that early step.

<letsencrypt_http_service>Let's Encrypt HTTP service</letsencrypt_http_service>
<letsencrypt_http_service_explain>This feature lets Artica expose port 80 on your server so Let’s Encrypt can validate a certificate request (HTTP-01).[br]Use it if you are not using the reverse-proxy services or PulseReverse.[br]For example, you can generate a certificate for the Artica Web Console or for a DoH service when your Artica server is reachable on the public Internet.</letsencrypt_http_service_explain>
<letsencrypt_http_service_explain2>[b]Port 80 is not published permanently.[/b][br]Artica exposes port 80 only while sending a certificate request to the Let’s Encrypt servers.[br]Make sure this port is reachable from the Internet during that short window.</letsencrypt_http_service_explain2>
<hacluster_tcp_keepalives>TCP Keepalives (client & server)</hacluster_tcp_keepalives>
<hacluster_tcp_keepalives_explain>When enabled, the load-balancer sets TCP keepalives on client to proxy and proxy to Web server sockets.[br]This helps keep long-lived idle tunnels (e.g., WebSocket/CONNECT) from being dropped by NATs/firewalls and detects half-open connections.[br]
[b]Note: Keepalives don’t override Load-balancer timeouts—set appropriate timeout tunnel</hacluster_tcp_keepalives_explain>

<fingerprinting>Fingerprinting</fingerprinting>
<fingerprinting_explain>Browser fingerprinting is a method that requires clients to present the [b]technical characteristics of their browser[/b]. This presentation is only possible through a standard browser such as Firefox, Chrome, or Edge (i.e., environments that support JavaScript execution and cookies).[br]
Bots or HTTP scripts that cannot present themselves in this way will be rejected and will not be able to browse your website.[br]
Artica applies special handling for official crawlers (Google, Apple, ChatGPT, MSN).[br]
When identified, they are exempt from fingerprinting and can crawl your website for indexing.

<enforce_user_dns_ttl_explain>Ensure every DNS answer sent to clients has a TTL of at least [b]3600 seconds[/b], regardless of the upstream TTL or what’s stored in cache.[br]
When enabled, the DNS service rewrites low TTLs on the fly (both normal responses and cache hits) so clients will cache results for at least one hour.[br]
[b]Notes:[/b][br]
This changes only the [i]TTL presented to clients[/i]; it does not keep entries longer in the internal cache unless your cache policy allows it.[br]
If your upstream uses very short TTLs for fast changes/rotation, clamping may delay client-side visibility of those changes.
