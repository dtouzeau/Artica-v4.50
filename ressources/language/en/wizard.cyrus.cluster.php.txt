<WIZARD_CLUSTER_CYRUS_WELCOME>Welcome on the Wizard for Clustering mailboxes</WIZARD_CLUSTER_CYRUS_WELCOME>
<WIZARD_CLUSTER_CYRUS_EXPLAIN>This wizard will help you to create a mailbox server Active/passive on your network.[br]
To set this structure you need a second running Artica server with IMAP service.[br]
This second Artica server will be the mailboxes replica/slave.[br]
It will receive notifications from this server in order to replicate mailboxes in realtime.[br]
If the configuration is a success you will never loose mails.[br]
[br]The first operation is to check if the slave server store mandatories elements for linking procedure.[br]
If the link operation is a success the 2 artica servers (Master and slave) will change parameters and start the clustering production mode.[br]
You will be able to return back to a standalone mode so you will not loose mail on a failed operation.[br][br]
So, it's time to start the first procedure.[br]
Fill the form below by setting the remote server credentials.[br]This will help Artica to talk to the remote server for checking it's status.[br]
