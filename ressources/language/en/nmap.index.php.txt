<about_nmap>Nmap is a security scanner originally written by Gordon Lyon (Fyodor).[br]
It may be used to discover computers and services on a computer network,
thus creating a "map" of the network.[br]
Just like many simple port scanners, Nmap is capable of discovering passive services on a network despite
the fact that such services aren't advertising themselves with a service discovery protocol.[br]
In addition Nmap may be able to determine various details about the remote computers.[br]
These include operating system, device type, uptime, software product used to run a service,
exact version number of that product, presence of some firewall techniques and, on a local area network, even vendor of the remote network card.</about_nmap>
