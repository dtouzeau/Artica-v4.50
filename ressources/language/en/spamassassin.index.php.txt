<about>SpamAssassin is a mature, widely-deployed open source project that serves as a mail filter to identify Spam.[br]
SpamAssassin uses a variety of mechanisms including header and text analysis, Bayesian filtering, DNS blocklists, and collaborative filtering databases.[br]
SpamAssassin runs on a server, and filters spam before it reaches your mailbox</about>

<pyzor_text>Pyzor is a collaborative, networked system to detect and block spam using identifying digests of messages.[br]
Pyzor initially started out to be merely a Python implementation of Razor.(see http://pyzor.sourceforge.net)</pyzor_text>
<razor_text>ipul's Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam detection and
filtering network.[br]
Through user contribution, Razor establishes a distributed and constantly updating catalogue of spam in propagation that
is consulted by email clients to filter out known spam.[br]
Detection is done with statistical and randomized signatures that efficiently spot mutating spam content.[br]
User input is validated through reputation assignments based on consensus on report and revoke assertions which in turn is used for
computing confidence values associated with individual signatures</razor_text>
<report_safe>Encapsulate spam in an attachment</report_safe>
<report_safe_text>if this option is enabled, if an incoming message is tagged as spam, instead of modifying the original message,
SpamAssassin will create a new report message and attach the original message as a message/rfc822 MIME
part (ensuring the original message is completely preserved, not easily opened, and easier to recover).
If this option is disabled, incoming spam is only modified by adding some X-Spam- headers and no changes will be made to the body.[br]
In addition, a header named X-Spam-Report will be added to spam.[br]</report_safe_text>
<required_score>Score required for SpamAssassin to flag a message as spam</required_score>
<required_score_text>Set the score required before a mail is considered spam.[br]
n.nn can be an integer or a real number.[br]
5.0 is the default setting, and is quite aggressive; it would be suitable for a single-user setup,
but if you're an ISP installing SpamAssassin, you should probably set the default to be more conservative,
like 8.0 or 10.0.[br]
It is not recommended to automatically delete or discard messages marked as spam, as your users will complain,
but if you choose to do so, only delete messages with an exceptionally high score such as 15.0 or higher.</required_score_text>
<rewrite_header>Rewrite headers</rewrite_header>
<rewrite_header_txt>By default, suspected spam messages will not have the Subject, From or To lines tagged to indicate spam.[br]
By setting this option, the header will be tagged with value to indicate that a message is spam.[br]
For the From or To headers, this will take the form of an RFC 2822 comment following the address in parantheses.[br]
For the Subject header, this will be prepended to the original subject.[br]
Note that you should only use the _REQD_ and _SCORE_ tags when rewriting the Subject header if report_safe is 0.[br]
Otherwise, you may not be able to remove the SpamAssassin markup via the normal methods.[br]
Parentheses are not permitted in value if rewriting the From or To headers. (They will be converted to square brackets.)</rewrite_header_txt>

<trusted_networks>Trusted Networks</trusted_networks>
<trusted_networks_text>What networks or hosts are 'trusted' in your setup.[br]
Trusted in this case means that relay hosts on these networks are considered to not be potentially operated by spammers,
open relays, or open proxies.
[br]
A trusted host could conceivably relay spam, but will not originate it, and will not forge header data.[br]
DNS blacklist checks will never query for hosts on these networks.[br]
MXes for your domain(s) and internal relays should also be specified using the internal networks setting.[br]
When there are 'trusted' hosts that are not MXes or internal relays for your domain(s) they should only be specified in trusted networks.[br]
If a /mask is specified, it's considered a CIDR-style 'netmask', specified in bits.[br]
If it is not specified, but less than 4 octets are specified with a trailing dot, that's considered a mask to allow
all addresses in the remaining octets.[br]
If a mask is not specified, and there is not trailing dot, then just the single IP address specified is used, as if the mask was /32.
If a network or host address is prefaced by a ! the network or host will be excluded (or included) in a first listed match fashion.[br]
[i]Note: 127/8 is always included in trusted_networks, regardless of your config.[/i][br]
[blk]Examples:
[li]192.168/16 (all in 192.168.*.*)[/li]
[li]212.17.35.15 (just that host)[/li]
[li]!10.0.1.5 10.0.1/24   (all in 10.0.1.* but not 10.0.1.5)[/li]

<use_auto_whitelist>Enable automatic whitelist</use_auto_whitelist>
<use_auto_whitelist_text>The auto-whitelist, aka automatic whitelist or AWL, tracks scores for your regular correspondents in a small on-disk database.[br]
In 3.1, it is a plugin, loaded by default in the file v310.pre.[br]
The AWL is actually a very simple system.[BR]
In short, the AWL is a score averaging system.[BR]
It keeps track of the historical average of a sender, and pushes any subsequent mail towards that average.[br]
So if someone that never sent you mail before sends you a mail that scores 20, and then sends you a second mail that would score 2.0 without the AWL,
the AWL will push the score up to 11 on the second mail.[br]
This is auto blacklisting, based on their past history of spam.[br]
If that same person sent you a mail that scored 0, and then later sent one that scored 7,
the AWL would push the score down to 3.5.[br]
This is auto-whitelisting based on past history of nonspam.[br]
A "sender" is identified using both the address they sent with, and their IP address, so spam claiming to be From you with forged headers will fail to get through.[br]
But the "auto whitelist" isn't really a whitelist per-se. [br]
It does however have a "learning white/blacklist" type behavior as a result of its averaging.[br]
Sometimes it may appear that the AWL is assigning scores the wrong way;</use_auto_whitelist_text>
