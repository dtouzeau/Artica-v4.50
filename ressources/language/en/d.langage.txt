<APP_STRONGSWAN>IPSEC</APP_STRONGSWAN>
<APP_STRONGSWAN_ABOUT_EXPLAIN>strongSwan is an OpenSource IPsec implementation. It was originally based on the discontinued FreeS/WAN project and the X.509 patch that we developed. In order to have a stable IPsec platform to base the extensions of the X.509 capability on, we decided to launch the strongSwan project in 2005.[br][br]The maintainer of the strongSwan project is Andreas Steffen, who is a professor for security in communications and head of the Institute for Networked Solutions at the University of Applied Sciences Rapperswil in Switzerland and president of the consulting firm strongSec GmbH.[br][br]website</APP_STRONGSWAN_ABOUT_EXPLAIN>

<Authby_Explain>How the two security gateways should authenticate each other; acceptable values are secret or psk
for pre-shared secrets, pubkey (the default) for public key signatures as well as the synonyms rsasig
for RSA digital signatures and ecdsasig for Elliptic Curve DSA signatures.
never can be used if negotiation is never to be attempted or accepted (useful for shunt-only conns).
Digital signatures are superior in every way to shared secrets. IKEv1 additionally supports the values
xauthpsk and xauthrsasig that will enable eXtended Authentication (XAuth) in addition to IKEv1 main
mode based on shared secrets or digital RSA signatures, respectively.
This parameter is deprecated for IKEv2 connections (and IKEv1 connections since 5.0.0), as two peers
do not need to agree on an authentication method. Use the left|rightauth parameter instead to define
authentication methods.</Authby_Explain>
<Auto_Explain>What operation, if any, should be done automatically at IPsec startup. add loads a connection without
starting it. route loads a connection and installs kernel traps. If traffic is detected between
leftsubnet and rightsubnet, a connection is established. start loads a connection and brings
it up immediately. ignore ignores the connection. This is equal to deleting a connection from the config
file. Relevant only locally, other end need not agree on it.</Auto_Explain>
<ClusterNotReplicateTasks>Do Not Replicate Tasks</ClusterNotReplicateTasks>
<Compress_Explain>Whether IPComp compression of content is proposed on the connection (link-level compression does not work on
encrypted data, so to be effective, compression must be done before encryption). A value of yes causes the daemon
to propose both compressed and uncompressed, and prefer compressed. A value of no prevents the daemon from proposing or accepting compression.</Compress_Explain>
<Conn_Explain>Name of connection. Don't use special characters or spaces. Example: siteX-to-siteY</Conn_Explain>
<conn_name>Connection Name</conn_name>
<DHCP_SERVICE_STRONGSWAN>DHCP Plugin</DHCP_SERVICE_STRONGSWAN>
<DHCP_SERVICE_STRONGSWAN_EXPLAIN>When an IKEv2 client requests a virtual IP address via a configuration payload, the plugin allows the daemon to forward this request to a DHCP server. By default the plugin uses broadcasts, but a designated DHCP server can be configured in this section.</DHCP_SERVICE_STRONGSWAN_EXPLAIN>
<DNSWINS_SERVICE_STRONGSWAN>Assignment of Internal DNS and WINS Servers</DNSWINS_SERVICE_STRONGSWAN>
<DNSWINS_SERVICE_STRONGSWAN_EXPLAIN>Windows requests internal DNS and WINS server information from the strongSwan gateway via the IKEv2 Configuration Payload (CP).</DNSWINS_SERVICE_STRONGSWAN_EXPLAIN>
<Dpdaction_Explain>Controls the use of the Dead Peer Detection protocol (DPD, RFC 3706) where R_U_THERE notification messages
(IKEv1) or empty INFORMATIONAL messages (IKEv2) are periodically sent in order to check the liveliness of the
IPsec peer. The values clear, hold, and restart all activate DPD and determine the action to perform on a timeout.
With clear the connection is closed with no further actions taken. hold installs a trap policy, which will catch
matching traffic and tries to re-negotiate the connection on demand. restart will immediately trigger an attempt
to re-negotiate the connection. The default is none which disables the active sending of DPD messages.</Dpdaction_Explain>
<Dpddelay_Explain>Defines the period time interval with which R_U_THERE messages/INFORMATIONAL exchanges are sent to the peer.
These are only sent if no other traffic is received. In IKEv2, a value of 0 sends no additional INFORMATIONAL
messages and uses only standard messages (such as those to rekey) to detect dead peers.</Dpddelay_Explain>
<Dpdtimeout_Explain>Defines the timeout interval, after which all connections to a peer are deleted in case of inactivity.
This only applies to IKEv1, in IKEv2 the default retransmission timeout applies, as every exchange is used to
detect dead peers.</Dpdtimeout_Explain>
<EapIdentity_Explain>Defines the identity the client uses to reply to an EAP Identity request. If defined on the EAP server, the defined identity will be used as peer identity during EAP authentication. The special value %identity uses the EAP Identity method to ask the client for a EAP identity. If not defined, the IKEv2 identity will be used as EAP identity.</EapIdentity_Explain>
<Esp_Explain>Comma-separated list of ESP encryption/authentication algorithms to be used for the connection, e.g.
aes128-sha256. The notation is encryption-integrity[-dhgroup][-esnmode].
For IKEv2, multiple algorithms (separated by -) of the same type can be included in a single proposal.
IKEv1 only includes the first algorithm in a proposal. Only either the ah or the esp keyword may
be used, AH+ESP bundles are not supported.</Esp_Explain>
<Forceencaps_Explain>Force UDP encapsulation for ESP packets even if no NAT situation is detected.
This may help to surmount restrictive firewalls. In order to force the peer to
encapsulate packets, NAT detection payloads are faked.
Not supported for IKEv1 connections prior to 5.0.0.</Forceencaps_Explain>
<Fragmentation_Explain>Fhether to use IKE fragmentation (proprietary IKEv1 extension or IKEv2 fragmentation as per RFC 7383).
Fragmented messages sent by a peer are always processed irrespective of the value of this option (even when set to no).
If set to yes (the default since 5.5.1) and the peer supports it, oversized IKE messages will be sent in fragments (the
maximum fragment size can be configured in strongswan.conf). If set to accept (available since 5.5.3) support for
fragmentation is announced to the peer but the daemon does not send its own messages in fragments.
If set to force (only supported for IKEv1) the initial IKE message will already be fragmented if required.
Available for IKEv1 connections since 5.0.2 and for IKEv2 connections since 5.2.1.</Fragmentation_Explain>
<HttpQueueTimeout>Queue Timeout</HttpQueueTimeout>
<Ikelifetime_Explain>Absolute time after which an IKE SA expires. Examples: 1h, 3600s, 28800s</Ikelifetime_Explain>
<Ike_Explain>Comma-separated list of IKE/ISAKMP SA encryption/authentication algorithms to be used, e.g.
aes128-sha256-modp3072. The notation is encryption-integrity[-prf]-dhgroup. In IKEv2, multiple algorithms
and proposals may be included, such as aes128-aes256-sha1-modp3072-modp2048,3des-sha1-md5-modp1024.[br]
The ability to configure a PRF algorithm different to that defined for integrity protection was added with 5.0.2.
If no PRF is configured, the algorithms defined for integrity are proposed as PRF. The prf keywords are the same as
the integrity algorithms, but have a prf prefix (such as prfsha1, prfsha256 or prfaesxcbc).</Ike_Explain>
<Keyexchange_Explain>Method of key exchange; which protocol should be used to initialize the connection.</Keyexchange_Explain>
<Keyingtries_Explain>How many attempts (a positive integer or %forever) should be made to negotiate a connection, or a replacement
for one, before giving up (default 3). The value %forever means 'never give up'. Relevant only locally, other end need
not agree on it.</Keyingtries_Explain>
<LeftRightauth2_Explain>Same as left|rightauth, but defines an additional authentication exchange. In IKEv1, only XAuth can be used
in the second authentication round. IKEv2 supports multiple complete authentication rounds using
Multiple Authentication Exchanges defined in RFC 4739. This allows e.g. a separate authentication of host and user.</LeftRightauth2_Explain>
<LeftRightauth_Explain>Authentication method to use locally (left) or require from the remote (right) side. Acceptable values are pubkey
for public key encryption (RSA/ECDSA), psk for pre-shared key authentication, eap to [require the] use of the Extensible Authentication Protocol, and xauth for IKEv1 eXtended Authentication.</LeftRightauth_Explain>
<LeftRightCert_Explain>The path to the left|right participant's X.509 certificate. The file can be coded either in PEM or DER format.</LeftRightCert_Explain>
<LeftRightDNS_Explain>Comma separated list of DNS server addresses to exchange as configuration attributes. On the initiator,
a server is a fixed IPv4/IPv6 address, or %config4/%config6 to request attributes without an address.
On the responder, only fixed IPv4/IPv6 addresses are allowed and define DNS servers assigned to the client.</LeftRightDNS_Explain>
<LeftRightFirewall_Explain>Whether the left|right participant is doing forwarding-firewalling (including masquerading)
using iptables for traffic from left|rightsubnet, which should be turned off for traffic to the
other subnet) once the connection is established. May not be used in the same connection description with
left|rightupdown. Implemented as a parameter to the default ipsec _updown script. Relevant only
locally, other end need not agree on it.</LeftRightFirewall_Explain>
<LeftRightId_Explain>How the left|right participant should be identified for authentication; defaults to left|right or the subject of the certificate configured with left|rightcert. If left|rightcert is configured the identity has to be confirmed by the certificate, that is, it has to match the full subject DN or one of the subjectAltName extensions contained in the certificate.[br]
Can be an IP address, a fully-qualified domain name, an email address or a Distinguished Name for which the
ID type is determined automatically and the string is converted to the appropriate encoding.</LeftRightId_Explain>
<LeftRightSendcert_Explain>Accepted values are never or no, always or yes, and ifasked, the latter meaning that
the peer must send a certificate request (CR) payload in order to get a certificate in return.</LeftRightSendcert_Explain>
<LeftRightSubnet_Explain>Private subnet behind the left participant, expressed as network/netmask; if omitted, essentially assumed
to be left/32|128, signifying that the left|right end of the connection goes to the left|right participant only.
The configured subnets of the peers may differ, the protocol narrows it to the greatest common subnet.
Since 5.0.0 this is also done for IKEv1, but as this may lead to problems with other implementations,
make sure to configure identical subnets in such configurations.
IKEv2 supports multiple subnets separated by commas, IKEv1 only interprets the first subnet of such a definition,
unless the Cisco Unity extension plugin is enabled (available since 5.0.1). This is due to a limitation of the IKEv1
protocol, which only allows a single pair of subnets per CHILD_SA. So to tunnel several subnets a conn entry has
to be defined and brought up for each pair of subnets.

Since 5.1.0 the optional part after each subnet enclosed in square brackets specifies a protocol/port to restrict
the selector for that subnet. Examples: leftsubnet=10.0.0.1[tcp/http],10.0.0.2[6/80] or leftsubnet=fec1::1[udp],10.0.0.0/16[/53].
Instead of omitting either value %any can be used to the same effect, e.g. leftsubnet=fec1::1[udp/%any],10.0.0.0/16[%any/53].

Since 5.1.1, if the protocol is icmp or ipv6-icmp the port is interpreted as ICMP message type if it is less than 256,
or as type and code if it greater or equal to 256, with the type in the most significant 8 bits and the code in the
least significant 8 bits.

The port value can alternatively take the value %opaque for RFC 4301 OPAQUE selectors, or a numerical range
in the form 1024-65535. None of the kernel backends currently supports opaque or port ranges and uses %any
for policy installation instead.

Instead of specifying a subnet, %dynamic can be used to replace it with the IKE address, having the same effect
as omitting left|rightsubnet completely. Using %dynamic can be used to define multiple dynamic selectors,
each having a potentially different protocol/port definition.</LeftRightSubnet_Explain>
<LeftRight_Explain>The IP address of the participant's public-network interface or one of several magic values.
The value %any for the local endpoint signifies an address to be filled in
(by automatic keying) during negotiation. If the local peer initiates the connection setup the routing table
will be queried to determine the correct local IP address. In case the local peer is responding to a connection
setup then any IP address that is assigned to a local interface will be accepted. The value %any4 restricts
address selection to IPv4 addresses, the value %any6 reistricts address selection to IPv6 addresses.[br]
Prior to 5.0.0 specifying %any for the local endpoint was not supported for IKEv1 connections, instead
the keyword %defaultroute could be used, causing the value to be filled in automatically with the local
address of the default-route interface (as determined at IPsec startup time and during configuration
update). Either left or right may be %defaultroute, but not both.[br]
The prefix % in front of a fully-qualified domain name or an IP address will implicitly set left|rightallowany=yes.[br]
If %any is used for the remote endpoint it literally means any IP address.[br]
If an FQDN is assigned it is resolved every time a configuration lookup is done. If DNS resolution times out,
the lookup is delayed for that time.[br]
Since 5.1.1 connections can be limited to a specific range of hosts. To do so a range (10.1.0.0-10.2.255.255)
or a subnet (10.1.0.0/16) can be specified, and multiple addresses, ranges and subnets can be separated by commas.
While one can freely combine these items, to initiate the connection at least one non-range/subnet is required.[br]
Please note that with the usage of wildcards multiple connection descriptions might match a given incoming
connection attempt. The most specific description is used in that case.</LeftRight_Explain>
<Leftsourceip_Explain>The internal source IP to use in a tunnel, also known as virtual IP.
If the value is one of the synonyms %config, %cfg, %modeconfig or %modecfg, an address (from
the tunnel address family) is requested from the peer.</Leftsourceip_Explain>
<Lifetime_Explain>How long a particular instance of a connection (a set of encryption/authentication keys for user packets)
should last, from successful negotiation to expiry; acceptable values are an integer optionally followed by
s (a time in seconds) or a decimal number followed by m, h, or d (a time in minutes, hours,
or days respectively) (default 1h, maximum 24h). Normally, the connection is renegotiated (via the
keying channel) before it expires (see margintime). The two ends need not exactly agree on lifetime, although if they
do not, there will be some clutter of superseded connections on the end which thinks the lifetime is longer.</Lifetime_Explain>

<LOG_STRONGSWAN_EXPLAIN>Define the retention time and if you want to send data to a remote syslog server.</LOG_STRONGSWAN_EXPLAIN>

<Rekey_Explain>Whether a connection should be renegotiated when it is about to expire. The two ends need not agree, but
while a value of no prevents the daemon from requesting renegotiation, it does not prevent responding

<strongSwanDHCPForceServerAddress_EXPLAIN>Always use the configured server address.[br]If the DHCP server runs on the same host as the daemon with DHCP plugin, you may need to enable charon.plugins.dhcp.force_server_address and then set charon.plugins.dhcp.server to the local broadcast address (e.g. 192.168.0.255). That's because some DHCP daemons do not listen on the loopback interface and, thus, can't be reached via unicast (or even broadcast, 255.255.255.255) from the same host.</strongSwanDHCPForceServerAddress_EXPLAIN>

<strongSwanUniqueids_explain>Whether a particular participant ID should be kept unique, with any new IKE_SA using an ID deemed to replace all old ones using that ID. [br]Participant IDs normally are unique, so a new IKE_SA using the same ID is almost invariably intended to replace an old one.[br]The difference between no and never is that the daemon will replace old IKE_SAs when receiving an INITIAL_CONTACT notify if the option is no but will ignore these notifies if never is configured.[br]The daemon also accepts the value replace which is identical to yes and the value keep to reject new IKE_SA setups and keep the duplicate established earlier.</strongSwanUniqueids_explain>

<pconn_lifetime>Persistent Connection Lifetime</pconn_lifetime>
<pconn_lifetime_text>Desired maximum lifetime of a persistent connection.[BR][BR]When set, Squid will close a now-idle persistent connection that exceeded configured lifetime instead of moving the connection into the idle connection pool (or equivalent). No effect on ongoing/active transactions. Connection lifetime is the time period from the connection acceptance or opening time until "now".[BR][BR]This limit is useful in environments with long-lived connections where Squid configuration or environmental factors change during a single connection lifetime. If unrestricted, some connections may last for hours and even days, ignoring those changes that should have affected their behavior or their existence.[BR][BR]Currently, a new lifetime value supplied via Squid reconfiguration has no effect on already idle connections unless they become busy.[BR][BR]When set to '0' this limit is not used.</pconn_lifetime_text>

<recursive_search_explain>This option will force the Hotspot to search recursively Members and Groups.[BR]Example: If you add AD Group X  into Hotspot authentication and if group Y is memberof Group X, this means that members of Group Y will be also able to authenticatice trounght the Hotspot.</recursive_search_explain>

<use_vmac_explain>To reduce the impact of takeovers in some networking environments, VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) can be used with VMAC (Virtual MAC) addresses. To achieve this, the Keepalived VRRP framework implements VMAC support</use_vmac_explain>

<ipvlan_explain>IPvlan is similar to MacVLAN technology, with one key difference: IPvlan does not assign unique MAC addresses to its sub-interfaces.[br]Instead, all sub-interfaces share the MAC address of the parent interface while using unique IP addresses.</ipvlan_explain>
