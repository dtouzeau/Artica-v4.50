<DelayEmbargoTime_text>Enter the number of minutes for which delivery, related with new 'triplet' (IP address of the sending
host + mail from + rcpt to), is refused with a temporary failure.[br]
 Default is 5 minutes.</DelayEmbargoTime_text>

<DelayExpiryTime_text>Enter the number of days for which whitelisted 'tuplet' is considered valid. Default is 36 days.</DelayExpiryTime_text>
<DelayGripvalue>Gripvalue</DelayGripvalue>
<DelayGripvalue_text>This will restrict Delaying/Greylisting to IPs with a Gripvalue above this value.[br]
For example 0.4.[br]
You may set it higher to 0.5 if you want to delay only IPs with a higher probability to send Spam.[br]
The local griplist is build during rebuildspamdb and uploaded to a global database.[br]
In return the global griplist is downloaded.[br]
The Gripvalue is calculated from the "spamminess" , where 0 means the IP-Block never sends spam and 1 it always send spam.

<DelayWaitTime>Wait time</DelayWaitTime>
<DelayWaitTime_text>Enter the number of hours to wait for delivery attempts related with recognised 'triplet'; delivery is accepted
immediately and the 'tuplet' (IP address of the sending host + sender's domain) is safelisted.[br]
Default is 28 hours.</DelayWaitTime_text>
<EnableDelaying_text>
Greylisting involves sending a temporary 451 SMTP error code to the sending server when a message is received, 
along with sending this error code ASSP creates a Triplet and stores this.[br]
 On the second delivery attempt if the Embargo Time set by the ASSP admin for the Triplet has been surpassed the message 
 will be accepted and a Tuplet will be created and not delayed again for an Expiry Time set by the ASSP admin.</EnableDelaying_text>
