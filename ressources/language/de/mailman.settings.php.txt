<bounce_processing>Enable bounce processing</bounce_processing>
<bounce_processing_sec>Bounce processing</bounce_processing_sec>
<bounce_processing_sec_text>These policies control the automatic bounce processing system in Mailman. Here's an overview of how it works.[br]
When a bounce is received, Mailman tries to extract two pieces of information from the message: the address of the member the message was intended for, and the severity of
the problem causing the bounce. The severity can be either hard or soft meaning either a fatal error occurred, or a transient error occurred.[br]
When in doubt, a hard severity is used.
If no member address can be extracted from the bounce, then the bounce is usually discarded.[br]
Otherwise, each member is assigned a bounce score and every time we encounter a bounce from this member we increment the score.[br]
Hard bounces increment by 1 while soft bounces increment by 0.5.[br]
We only increment the bounce score once per day, so even if we receive ten hard bounces from a member per day, their score will increase by only 1 for that day.[br]
When a member's bounce score is greater than the bounce score threshold, the subscription is disabled.[br]
Once disabled, the member will not receive any postings from the list until their membership is explicitly re-enabled (either by the list administrator or the user).
[br]However, they will receive occasional reminders that their membership has been disabled, and these reminders will include information about how to re-enable their membership.[br]
You can control both the number of reminders the member will receive and the frequency with which these reminders are sent.[br]
There is one other important configuration variable;[br] after a certain period of time -- during which no bounces from the member are received -- the bounce information is considered stale and discarded.
[br]Thus by adjusting this value, and the score threshold, you can control how quickly bouncing members are disabled.
[br]You should tune both of these to the frequency and traffic volume of your list</bounce_processing_sec_text>
<bounce_processing_text>Should Mailman perform automatic bounce processing?[br]
By setting this value to No, you disable all automatic bounce processing for this list, however bounce messages will still be discarded so that the list administrator isn't inundated with them.</bounce_processing_text>
<bounce_score_threshold>Maximum member bounce score</bounce_score_threshold>
<bounce_score_threshold_text>The maximum member bounce score before the member's subscription is disabled.[br]
This value can be a floating point number.[br]
Each subscriber is assigned a bounce score, as a floating point number.[br]
Whenever Mailman receives a bounce from a list member, that member's score is incremented.[br]
Hard bounces (fatal errors) increase the score by 1, while soft bounces (temporary errors) increase the score by 0.5.[br]
Only one bounce per day counts against a member's score, so even if 10 bounces are received for a member on the same day, their score will increase by just 1.[br]
This variable describes the upper limit for a member's bounce score, above which they are automatically disabled, but not removed from the mailing list.</bounce_score_threshold_text>
<bounce_unrecognized_goes_to_list_owner>Bounce messages that failed to be detected</bounce_unrecognized_goes_to_list_owner>
<bounce_unrecognized_goes_to_list_owner_text>Should Mailman send you, the list owner, any bounce messages that failed to be detected by the bounce processor?[br]
Yes  is recommended.[br]
While Mailman's bounce detector is fairly robust, it's impossible to detect every bounce format in the world.[br]
You should keep this variable set to Yes for two reasons: [br]
1) If this really is a permanent bounce from one of your members, you should probably manually remove them from your list, and
[br]2) you might want to send the message on to the Mailman developers so that this new format can be added to its known set.[br]
If you really can't be bothered, then set this variable to No and all non-detected bounces will be discarded without further processing.[br]
Note: This setting will also affect all messages sent to your list's -admin address.[br]
This address is deprecated and should never be used, but some people may still send mail to this address.[br]
If this happens, and this variable is set to No those messages too will get discarded.[br]
You may want to set up an autoresponse message for email to the -owner and -admin address.</bounce_unrecognized_goes_to_list_owner_text>

<contentfiltering>Content filtering</contentfiltering>
<contentfiltering_text>
Policies concerning the content of list traffic.[br]
Content filtering works like this: when a message is received by the list and you have enabled content filtering, the individual attachments are first compared to the filter types.
[br]If the attachment type matches an entry in the filter types, it is discarded.
[br]Then, if there are pass types defined, any attachment type that does not match a pass type is also discarded.
[br]If there are no pass types defined, this check is skipped.
[br]After this initial filtering, any multipart attachments that are empty are removed.
[br]If the outer message is left empty after this filtering, then the whole message is discarded.
[br]Then, each multipart/alternative section will be replaced by just the first alternative that is non-empty after filtering if collapse_alternatives is enabled.
[br]Finally, any text/html parts that are left in the message may be converted to text/plain if convert_html_to_plaintext is enabled and the site is configured to allow these conversions.

By default, should new list member postings be moderated?[br]
Each list member has a moderation flag which says whether messages from the list member can be posted directly to the list,
or must first be approved by the list moderator.[br]
When the moderation flag is turned on, list member postings must be approved first.[br]
You, the list administrator can decide whether a specific individual's postings will be moderated or not.[br]
When a new member is subscribed, their initial moderation flag takes its value from this option.[br]
Turn this option off to accept member postings by default. Turn this option on to, by default, moderate member postings first.[br]
You can always manually set an individual member's moderation bit by using the membership management screens

<encode_ascii_prefixes>Encode ASCII prefixes</encode_ascii_prefixes>
<encode_ascii_prefixes_text>
If your mailing list's default language uses a non-ASCII character set[br]
and the prefix contains non-ASCII characters, the prefix will always[br]
be encoded according to the relevant standards.  However, if your[br]
prefix contains only ASCII characters, you may want to set this option[br]
to Never to disable prefix encoding.  This can make the subject[br]
headers slightly more readable for users with mail readers that don't[br]
properly handle non-ASCII encodings.[br]
 [br]
Note however, that if your mailing list receives both encoded and[br]
unencoded subject headers, you might want to choose As needed.  Using[br]
this setting, Mailman will not encode ASCII prefixes when the rest of[br]
the header contains only ASCII characters, but if the original header[br]
contains non-ASCII characters, it will encode the prefix.  This avoids[br]
an ambiguity in the standards which could cause some mail readers to[br]
display extra, or missing spaces between the prefix and the original[br]
header.[br]

Note this action is not taken if after filtering the message still contains content.
[br]In that case the message is always forwarded on to the list membership.
[br]When messages are discarded, a log entry is written containing the Message-ID of the discarded message.
[br]When messages are rejected or forwarded to the list owner, a reason for the rejection is included in the bounce message to the original author.

Use Defer to temporarily disable a rule.[br]
You can have more than one filter rule for your list.[br]
In that case, each rule is matched in turn, with processing stopped after the first match.[br]

However, not all mail readers are standards compliant yet, and if you[br]

readers, they may be annoyed at these headers.  You should first try[br]
to educate your members as to why these headers exist, and how to hide[br]
them in their mail clients.  As a last resort you can disable these[br]

<news_moderation>Moderation</news_moderation>
<news_moderation_text>The moderation policy of the newsgroup.[br]
This setting determines the moderation policy of the newsgroup and its interaction with the moderation policy of the mailing list.
[br]This only applies to the newsgroup that you are gatewaying to, so if you are only gatewaying from Usenet, or the newsgroup you are gatewaying to is not moderated, set this option to None.
[br]If the newsgroup is moderated, you can set this mailing list up to be the moderation address for the newsgroup.
[br]By selecting Moderated, an additional posting hold will be placed in the approval process.
[br]All messages posted to the mailing list will have to be approved before being sent on to the newsgroup, or to the mailing list membership.
Note that if the message has an Approved header with the list's administrative password in it, this hold test will be bypassed, allowing privileged posters
to send messages directly to the list and the newsgroup.[br]
Finally, if the newsgroup is moderated, but you want to have an open posting policy anyway, you should select Open list, moderated group.
[br]The effect of this is to use the normal Mailman moderation facilities, but to add an Approved header to all messages that are gatewayed to Usenet.</news_moderation_text>
<news_prefix_subject_too>Prefix Subject: in news</news_prefix_subject_too>
<news_prefix_subject_too_text>
Prefix Subject: headers on postings gated to news?[br]
Mailman prefixes Subject: headers with text you can customize and normally, this prefix shows up in messages gatewayed to Usenet.[br]
You can set this option to No to disable the prefix on gated messages. [br]Of course, if you turn off normal Subject: prefixes, they won't be prefixed for gated messages either

Setting this option causes member email addresses to be transformed when they are presented on list web pages (both in text and as links),[br]

Postings from any of these non-members will be automatically rejected. In other words, their messages will be bounced back to the sender with a notification of automatic rejection.[br]
This option is not appropriate for known spam senders; their messages should be automatically discarded.[br]

<reply_goes_to_list>Reply-To model</reply_goes_to_list>
<reply_goes_to_list_text>
Some mailing lists have restricted posting privileges, with a parallel[br]
list devoted to discussions.  Examples are `patches' or `checkin'[br]
lists, where software changes are posted by a revision control system,[br]
but discussion about the changes occurs on a developers mailing list.[br]
To support these types of mailing lists, select Explicit address and[br]
set the Reply-To: address below to point to the parallel list.</reply_goes_to_list_text>

<require_explicit_destination>Require explicit destination</require_explicit_destination>
<require_explicit_destination_text>Must posts have list named in destination (to, cc) field (or be among the acceptable alias names, specified below)?[br]
Many (in fact, most) spams do not explicitly name their myriad destinations in the explicit destination addresses [br]
- in fact often the To: field has a totally bogus address for obfuscation.[br]
The constraint applies only to the stuff in the address before the '@' sign, but still catches all such spams.[br]
The cost is that the list will not accept unhindered any postings relayed from other addresses, unless[ul]
[li]1. The relaying address has the same name, or[/li]
[li]2. The relaying address name is included on the options that specifies acceptable aliases for the list.[/li]

<sender_filters>Sender Filters</sender_filters>
<sender_filters_text>When a message is posted to the list, a series of moderation steps are take to decide whether the a moderator must first approve the message or not.[br]
This section contains the controls for moderation of both member and non-member postings.[br]
Member postings are held for moderation if their moderation flag is turned on.[br]
You can control whether member postings are moderated by default or not.[br]
Non-member postings can be automatically accepted, held for moderation, rejected (bounced), or discarded, either individually or as a group.[br]
Any posting from a non-member who is not explicitly accepted, rejected, or discarded, will have their posting filtered by the general non-member rules.[br]
In the text boxes below, add one address per line; start the line with a ^ character to designate a Python regular expression.[br]
When entering backslashes, do so as if you were using Python raw strings (i.e. you generally just use a single backslash).[br]
Note that non-regexp matches are always done first.

<subject_prefix>Subject Prefix</subject_prefix>
<subject_prefix_text>This text will be prepended to subject lines of messages posted to the list,[br]
to distinguish mailing list messages in mailbox summaries.[br]Brevity is premium here, it's ok to shorten long mailing list names to[br]
something more concise, as long as it still identifies the mailing list.[br][br] You can also add a sequential number by %d substitution
directive. eg.; [ul][li][listname %d] -&amp;raquo; [listname 123][/li][li] (listname %05d) -&amp;raquo; (listname 00123)[/li][/ul]</subject_prefix_text>

[li]Confirm and approve - both confirm and approve[/li]
[/ul]
(*) when someone requests a subscription, Mailman sends them a notice with a unique subscription request number that they must reply to in order to subscribe.[br]
This prevents mischievous (or malicious) people from creating subscriptions for others without their consent.</subscribe_policy_text>

<topics>Topics</topics>
<topics_bodylines_limit>Max line scanning</topics_bodylines_limit>
<topics_bodylines_limit_text>How many body lines should the topic matcher scan?[br]
The topic matcher will scan this many lines of the message body looking for topic keyword matches.
[br]Body scanning stops when either this many lines have been looked at, or a non-header-like body line is encountered.
[br]By setting this value to zero, no body lines will be scanned (i.e. only the Keywords: and Subject: headers will be scanned).
[br]By setting this value to a negative number, then all body lines will be scanned until a non-header-like line is encountered.
</topics_bodylines_limit_text>
<topics_enabled>Enable Topics</topics_enabled>
<topics_text>The topic filter categorizes each incoming email message according to regular expression filters you specify below.
[br]If the message's Subject: or Keywords: header contains a match against a topic filter, the message is logically placed into a topic bucket.
[br]Each user can then choose to only receive messages from the mailing list for a particular topic bucket (or buckets).
[br]Any message not categorized in a topic bucket registered with the user is not delivered to the list.
[br]Note that this feature only works with regular delivery, not digest delivery.
[br]The body of the message can also be optionally scanned for Subject: and Keywords: headers, as specified by the topics_bodylines_limit configuration variable.

Is the list moderator's approval required for unsubscription requests?[br](No is recommended)[br]
When members want to leave a list, they will make an unsubscription request, either via the web or via email.
[br]Normally it is best for you to allow open unsubscriptions so that users can easily remove themselves from mailing lists (they get really upset if they can't get off lists!).[br]
For some lists though, you may want to impose moderator approval before an unsubscription request is processed.
[br]Examples of such lists include a corporate mailing list that all employees are required to be members of.
