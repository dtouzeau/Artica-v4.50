<about> milter-greylist is a stand-alone milter written in C that implements the  greylist filtering method, as proposed by Evan Harris.[br]
Grey listing works by assuming that, unlike legitimate MTA, spam engines will not retry sending their junk mail on a temporary error.[br]
The filter will always reject mail temporarily on a first attempt, then accept it after some time has elapsed.</about>
<acl>Access List</acl>
<acl_text>
The primary use of this feautre is to setup milter-greylist whitelist.[br] It also offers a handy blacklist feature.[br] 
Access-lists (ACL) are used to do that.[br] ACL enable the administrator  to  specify  complex  conditions  on sender IP, sender DNS address,
sender e-mail address, and recipient e-mail address.[br]
If support for DNSRBL was built-in, it is even possible to use DNSRBL in ACL.</acl_text>
<addr>IP-Adresse</addr>
<addr_text>
This clause is used to specify a netblock of source IP addresses.[br]
The syntax is an IP address followed by a slash and a CIDR netmask.[br]
Here is an example:
[ul]
[li]127.0.0.0/8[/li]
[li]192.168.3.0/24[/li]
[li]::1[/li]
[/ul]
If the netmask is ommitted, /32 is assumed for an IPv4 address and /128 is assumed for an IPv6 address.[br]
You  should  at  least  whitelist localhost (127.0.0.1/8), and if you have some user clients connecting to the machine,
you should whitelist the addresses they connect from if you donâ€™t want them to get error messages when sending e-mail.

They must be defined and named before they can be used. Here is an example which uses a bigger greylisting delay for hosts caught in the SORBS dynamic pool DNRSBL (this
will include DSL and cable customers pools, which are well known to be massively infected by spamwares)[br]</dnsrbl_text>
