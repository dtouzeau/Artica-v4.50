and content filtering (statistical/bayesian content filtering,
pattern matching, URL filtering and heuristic filtering). j-chkmail detects virus by looking for suspicious attached
files (defined by their filename extensions or by some regular expression).[br]
An external message scanner such as Clamd (from ClamAV) can also be called during message handling.
