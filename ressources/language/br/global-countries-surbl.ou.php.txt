A Universal Resource Identifier (URI) is a standard means of addressing resources on the Web.[br]
Common URIs such as Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are used to identify the destination of hypertext links as well as the sources of images,
information and other objects in a Web Page. [br]
URLs are most generally used in web sites but can also be included as part of an email message body e.g. to attract new visitors to a web site.[br]

SURBLs differ from most other RBLs in that they are used to detect spam based on message body URIs.[br]
Unlike most other RBLs, SURBLs are not used to block spam senders.[br] Instead they allow you to block messages that have spam hosts (e.g. web servers, domains, web sites) which are mentioned in message bodies. [br]
This module use pourcent method to judge if a mail is sended by a black web or spamer computer.[br]
In the table below, you must reach 1OO% with a list of surbl servers database.[br]to increase the detection rate, you may exceed 100% of results[br]For example you can set[br]
[ul]
[li]rhsbl.ahbl.org as 20%[/li]
[li]multi.surbl.org as 30%[/li]
[li]adult.rhs.mailpolice.com as 70%[/li]
