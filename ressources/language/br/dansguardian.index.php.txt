DansGuardian is designed to be completely flexible and allows you to tailor the filtering to your exact needs.[br]
It can be as draconian or as unobstructive as you want.
[br]The default settings are geared towards what a primary school might want but DansGuardian puts you in control of what you want to block.

This setting also applies to content regular expression modification.[br]

Phrases you add will be assigned a point score and will be combined by DansGuardian to assign a total score for the web page being accessed.[br]
The total score required for DansGuardian to block the page is configured in global settings or in each rule settings.[br]
This system allows pages to be blocked much more accurately.[br]
[b]For example a web site containing the phrases sex and education would be allowed through the filter because the phrase education would be assigned a negative score 
to cancel out the score caused by the phrase sex.[/b][br]
In the field you can set one word eg "slut" and a score: 10 for example.[br]
You can set a rule that force to match [b]several words[/b] for one score.[br] If you set slut,horny and score to 50,means you Add 50 to the count when the strings 'slut' and 'horny' are found on the same page
