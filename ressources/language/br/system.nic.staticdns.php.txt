<nic_dns_search>Search list for host-name lookup</nic_dns_search>
<nic_dns_search_text>The search list is normally determined from the local domain name; by default, it contains only the local domain name.&lt;br&gt; This may be changed by listing the desired domain search path.&lt;br&gt;
If you refer to another server just by its name without the domain added on, DNS on your client will append the server name 
to each domain in this list and do an DNS lookup on each to get the remote servers IP address.&lt;br&gt;
This is a handy time saving feature to have so that you can refer to servers in the same domain by only their servername without having to specify the domain.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first domain listed must be the home domain of your network and The search list is currently limited to six domains with a total of 256 characters.</nic_dns_search_text>
