<clocks_text>Your computer has two timepieces; a battery-backed one that is always running as the ``hardware'', ``BIOS'', or ``CMOS'' clock,
and another that is maintained by the operating system currently running on your computer as the ``system'' clock.[br]
The hardware clock is generally only used to set the system clock when your operating system boots,
and then from that point until you reboot or turn off your system, the system clock is the one used to keep track of time.</clocks_text>
